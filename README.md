# rift

rift is a tiling window for macos. it is inspired by i3/sway/hyprland and aerospace's virtual workspace system.

### credits
rift originally began as a fork(and licensed as such) of [glide-wm](https://github.com/glide-wm/glide) but has since diverged significantly. it uses numerous private api's which were reverse engineered by yabai and other projects. it is not affiliated with glide-wm or yabai in any way.

### config
default config in rift.default.toml

### status
rift is very much a work in progress and not anywhere near completion
